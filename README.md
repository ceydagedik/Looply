# 🌐 Looply

Looply is a **Web3 platform** that enables users to **buy and sell second-hand products** in a secure and transparent way using **Stellar blockchain** technology.

Users can log in using their **Freighter Wallet**, list their products with photos that are **hashed and stored on the blockchain**, and set prices in **XLM or popular stablecoins**.  
Transactions are protected by a simple **ownership-based smart contract**, where funds are transferred to the seller only after the buyer confirms receipt of the product.

As a reward for successful transactions, users receive **small XLM micro-payments**.  
Looply ensures **trust, transparency, and verifiable ownership history** of each product directly on the blockchain — creating a more reliable and user-friendly second-hand shopping experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet:**  
   Users connect their Freighter wallet to authenticate.

2. **List a Product:**  
   Add product details and upload a photo (hashed and stored securely).

3. **Set a Price:**  
   Choose price in XLM or stablecoin.

4. **Transaction Flow:**  
   Buyer sends payment → blockchain confirms transaction → buyer approves delivery → seller receives funds.

5. **Reward System:**  
   Small XLM micro-payments are distributed for successful trades.

## ✅ Smart Contract Scope

- Maximum **3–4 simple functions**  
- Supports **basic read/write operations**  
- Stores minimal product and ownership data  
- Fully deployable on **Stellar Testnet**  

---

## 🔗 Integration Plan

- Freighter Wallet connect/disconnect  
- Call contract functions directly from frontend  
- Display returned data dynamically in UI  

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

- ✅ Contract can be deployed  
- ✅ Wallet connection works  
- ✅ Contract function can be called  
- ✅ Frontend displays returned results  
- ✅ End-to-end flow succeeds
